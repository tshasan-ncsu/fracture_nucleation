This is a database of plane strain finite element simulation outputs for hydrided zirconium materials. The following are descriptions of each column within the database:

Hydride Length: The length of the longest hydride axis, in meters.

Material Orientation: The angle in degrees from the loading axis of the grain structure. A maximum, randomized 10 degrees misorientation ocurred from grain to grain.

Hydride Volume Fraction: The volume fraction of hydrides compared with parent zirconium material. Measured in percentage.

Hydride Spacing: The longitudonal spacing between hydrides (tip to tip) measured in meters.

Strain: The strain level at which the data point was captured.

Gumbel Mu: The 'mu' parameter of the Gumbel distribution, fitted to the 95th percentile of the data.

Gumbel Beta: The 'beta' parameter of the Gumbel distribution, fitted to the 95th percentile of the data.

Known Crack Strain: The cracking strain for this set of material parameters.
